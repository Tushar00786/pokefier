# Pokéfier
The best autocatching program on Pokétwo to have been created till date. Why? Because it is free and doesn't log your token.

## Background
I was looking for a Pokétwo autocatcher on Github for quite a while and the ones I could find were either paid or extremely sketchy. There were some free ones which used the infamous "hint exploit" but that was just very unprofessional to me. Paying to exploit a Discord bot or running obfuscated code that can do god-knows-what was just not acceptable. So, if you are like me and can relate, Pokéfier is made just for you.

## Pokéfier and Machine Learning
Pokéfier uses machine learning to identify pokemon images, given a url or an image object. The program and the model is completely free. However, you would need to join our Discord server to avail the `labels` and `identifier` which contain the pokemon names and, if you want to autocatch on mobile, the link to the Pokéfier API.

The creation of this project was just like any other Machine Learning project. To recreate it, you would have to:[^note]
1. Create a model using a programming language of your choice and associated libraries
